/**
 * <p>
 * The binary automata writer is responsible for writing an automata in a binary
 * format to an output stream. Obviously, it cannot know how to handle the
 * supplementary data that can be provided as part of a state. Therefore, if the
 * automata contains states which have supplementary data, the client is expected
 * to deal with this.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> By default, this class complete ignores any supplementary data.
 * To allow writing this data, the client should extend this class and overwrite
 * the method <code>write(Automata.State)</code>. In such case, it is
 * recommended that <code>super.write(state)</code> is called before writing the
 * supplementary data. In other words, the standard information (i.e. kind and
 * children) for a state comes first, and the supplementary data is placed after
 * that.
 * </p>
