/**
 * <p>
 * The binary automata reader is responsible for reading an automata in a binary
 * format from an input stream. Obviously, it cannot know how to handle the
 * supplementary data that can be provided as part of a state. Therefore, if the
 * automata may contain states which have supplementary data, the client is
 * expected to deal with this.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> To handle supplementary data, the client should extend this
 * class and overwrite the method <code>readState()</code>. In such case, it is
 * recommended that <code>super.readState()</code> is called before reading the
 * supplementary data. In other words, the standard information (i.e. kind and
 * children) for a state comes first, and the supplementary data is placed after
 * that.
 * </p>
