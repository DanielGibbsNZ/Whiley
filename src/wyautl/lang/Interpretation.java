 * The primary use of this interface is for testing purposes. As an example, a
 * common kind of test is to check that a minimised automata accepts the same
 * set of values. Likewise, if one automata is thought to subsume another, then
 * is should be the case that all it accepts all of the values accepted by the
 * other.
