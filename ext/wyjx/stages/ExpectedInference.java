/**
 * <p>
 * The purpose of the expected inference is to identify which the direction in
 * which we expect conditional branches will be taken. In this sense, it's a
 * little like branch prediction. In this case, however, we "expect" that
 * programs are correct and that branches that lead to immediate failure will
 * not be taken.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The reason for this analysis is to simplify the task of verification. Roughly
 * speaking, a branch that will not be taken corresponds to checking for
 * <i>unsatisfiability</i> of the corresponding verification condition (which the
 * theorem prover does quickly). In contrast, branches which can be taken
 * require the theorem prover to generate a model (which, currently the theorem
 * prover does poorly).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The analysis proceeds as a backward flow analysis starting from fail
 * statements.
 * </p>
